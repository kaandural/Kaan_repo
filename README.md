Midterm Projects my wonderful classmates and I made during the Data Analytics Bootcamp of Ironhack.

Project 1: Berlin Crime Scene. It is an interactive data visualization Project made by Bryan Dunleavy and I. 
We wanted to create an interactive crime map of Berlin -hover with your mouse and see the crimes per neighborhood-
It took us a while to fit the data into a spatial map. 
Please check the Berlin_Crime notebook for more information about the project.
